        <p>Hey everyone! 
            <br> <br>
            What is it that excites teens about gaming? is it just playing with a joystick? Is it just to show how cool u are? actually it is a place where i connect emotionally,physically and mentally. you're not just watching the characters,you become a part of them. Just like the movie Jumanji.
            so my topic for todays speech is gaming.
            <br> <br>
            Lets start with my gamertag(my name inside a game). My tag is <em>MADMAX</em>. Back when i was in 3-4th standard my brother used to play counter strike on that dabba pc we had at home. I always used to see him play and i was like even i wanna play that game. I was a v mastikhor kind of a child at that time. So he gave me the name madmax in counter strike which still works well for me.

            Gaming has been a great part of my life. My mom still scolds me for playing games all day.
            I'm so addictive that I bunk clg lectures  and go to play in the cybercafes. Y'all might have seen my group of noob friends and me playing pubg,cod during lectures on the last benches. Screaming like hooligans while playing in that 1/2 hr break we have. Gaming is a great way to make new frnds and hold on to the group. Having all 10 frnds playing together in 5v5 match and winning against them is a great feeling.
            <br><br>
            According to me gaming is the best invention ever happened. Its a multibillion dollar business. the features have been advanced to such a level like look at the graphics of games nowadays. Virtual reality is like being inside the game and playing it. I used to think computer science luga toh college mein CS khelne milega and yes I do play it in the programming lecs. the only problem now is that I gotta do coding too. 
            <br><br>
            Science says gaming improves coordination, attention and problem sovling skills. it also helps enhancing our memory. Video gamers are also found to be better in multitasking, driving and navigating around the roads. Gamers are more likely to have creative hobbies and play musical instrument. regular gamers have relatively sharp reflexes which inturn helps write codes with less bugs. top notch companies like google also promotes gaming and adheres to this concept.

            My gaming has been amazing so far. like from playing GTA roadrash to playing assasins creed is so cool. I've a long list of games i have played till now. many more to join that list in future. one of my favourite games from that list is counter strike. the first game of my life is still my favourite. many other games like age of empires, tom clancy, warfare, call of duty are some of the best games I've ever played. It is my dream to open a gaming youtube channel so that I can entertain many people all around the world.
            <br><br>
            Gaming is like my refreshment. whenever I'm stressed or bored i call up my friends and play games with them. even when i was writing the speech SAPID 76 called me up and asked whether i was ready to play a game and we ended up playing 2 hours with 3 chicken dinners.
            <br><br>
            Lastly a pro tip from a noob player - a date might break your heart but playing a game wouldnt do that. </p>
