        <p>Almost everyone listens to music. Like how can someone say no to music. Every party is incomplete without music. Be it with friends or family, music connects us all the damn time. Finding someone with the same music taste as yours' is just so pleasing. Playing music, be it any instument or any remixes you make, just adds that +1 to your mood. I myself play Tabla which has been a part of my life since 10 years now. Having completed 5 exams of Tabla I'm left with the final 2. Enough of me now, lets have a look at some music tastes (which I prefer lol ).
